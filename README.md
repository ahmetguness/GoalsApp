App.js:
This is the main entry point of your Goals app. It sets up the overall structure of the app and manages the state of the goals.

The app uses React Native components such as View, FlatList, and Button for creating the UI.
The app's state includes a boolean modalIsVisible to control the visibility of the goal input modal, and an array myGoals to store the entered goals.
Functions like startAddGoalHandler and endAddGoalHandler are used to toggle the visibility of the goal input modal.
The addGoalHandler function adds a new goal to the myGoals array when the user submits a goal through the input modal.
The deleteGoalHandler function removes a goal from the myGoals array when the user presses the delete button on a goal item.
The component uses the FlatList component to display the list of goals using the GoalItem component.
GoalInput.js:
This component is responsible for displaying a modal where users can input new goals.

The modal displays an image, a text input field, and two buttons ("Add Goal" and "Cancel").
Users can input their goal in the text input field.
The addGoalHandler function is called when the "Add Goal" button is pressed, which adds the entered goal to the myGoals array via the onAddGoal prop.
The cancel function is called when the "Cancel" button is pressed, which closes the modal.
The visible prop controls the visibility of the modal.
GoalItem.js:
This component represents an individual goal item.

It displays the goal text inside a pressable view.
When the user presses a goal item, the onDeleteItem function is called with the item's ID to delete that specific goal.
The android_ripple prop adds a ripple effect to the pressable view when pressed.
The pressedItem style changes the opacity of the goal item when pressed, providing visual feedback to the user.
In summary, your Goals app allows users to add and delete goals. The App.js component manages the overall state and user interactions, the GoalInput.js component handles goal input and submission, and the GoalItem.js component displays individual goals with delete functionality. The app uses React Native components to create a user-friendly interface for managing goals.
